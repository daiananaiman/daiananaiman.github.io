<h1>Top Things to do in Petropavl</h1>
<h2>Lake Pestroye</h2>
<p>Southwest of the city lies Lake Pestroye, with a city beach that is suitable for swimming during summer and ice skating in winter. Nearby are 2 decent resorts: the Green Park Hotel, and the Park Hotel Pestroye.</p>

<p>Both house attractive Siberian-style log cabins, and feature summer and winter attractions for summer and winter seasons such as traditional Russian banya, forest obstacle courses, traditional yurts, husky sledding, snowmobiles, and walking/cycling tours.</p>
<h2>Ishim River</h2>
<p>The banks of the Ishim River north of the city also have city beaches in the summer, while stretches of the Ishim are popular for fishing.</p>

<p>Near the village of Saumalkol, Aiyrtau district stands the cone-shaped Karasai and Agyntai Batyr Memorial Complex, opened in 1999 to honour the 2 warriors who participated in over 200 bloody battles over a 48-year period, including famous victories such as the 1643 Battle of Orbulak. Both died within a year of each other (1671-1672), and are buried in the nearby Kulshynbay-Tobe hill.</p>
<p>More than anything else, the memorial is a testament to the country’s nation-building process. First president Nazarbayev is a descendant of Karasai’s Shaprashty Great Zhuz tribe.</p>
